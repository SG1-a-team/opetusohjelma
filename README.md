Schoolproject for OAMK's web-project course. Aim was to build a website with index -page, information -page 
and as many quiz pages as there are group members. In our case, it means five different quiz pages. Quiz pages 
are created by following group members: <br>

Animal quiz - Teemu Eskola <br>
Geography quiz - Tommi Järvenpää<br>
English quiz - Sari Suomela<br>
Science quiz - Timo Hyttinen<br>
